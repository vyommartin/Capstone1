<center><h1>Hair Style Detector</h1></center>

<p>Well, this was my first project. Where I attempted to make a hair type classifier.<br> Given Three Hairstyles: Straight, Wavy and Curly. <br><br>I used the ResNet18 model due to small free storage provided to me by the server. The batch size being set at 8, minimal Data Augmentations were used in training the model. The lack of storage space gave me the chance to explore how I can improve the model without hurting the accuracy.</p>
